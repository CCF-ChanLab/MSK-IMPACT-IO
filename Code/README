Description
1.GridSearch.py: Generates hyperparameters for RF16 and RF11.
2.RandomForestClassifier.py: Generates response probability of RF16 and RF11. Outputs are required for the other scripts. 
3.ROC_PRC_Training.R: Generates receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves. Also creates outputs with pan-cancer threshold and cancer-type-specific thresholds for RF16. 
4.ROC_PRC_Test.R: Generates receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves.  
5.Evaluate_Performance_Training_Pan.py: Generates confusion matrix and evaluation metrics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV) of each cancer type based on pan-cancer threshold. 
6.Evaluate_Performance_Training.py: Generates confusion matrix and evaluation metrics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV) of each cancer type based on cancer-type-specific threshold.
7.Evaluate_Performance_Test.py: Generates confusion matrix and evaluation metrics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV) of each cancer type based on cancer-type-specific threshold.
8.BrierScore_Training.R: Generates Brier score and plot of each cancer type. 
9.BrierScore_Test.R: Generates Brier score and plot of each cancer type.
10.Cindex_Training.R: Generates concordance index and compares values of RF16, RF11, and TMB.
11.Cindex_Test.R: Generates concordance index and compares values of RF16, RF11, and TMB.
12.Survival_Training.R: Generates Kaplan-Meier plots and hazard ratio comparing responder and non-responder predicted by RF16 or TMB.
13.Survival_Test.R: Generates Kaplan-Meier plots and hazard ratio comparing responder and non-responder predicted by RF16 or TMB.
